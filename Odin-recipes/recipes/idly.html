    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Idli (or idly) is a popular, nutritious <b><em>South Indian savory rice cake</em></b> made by steaming a fermented batter of rice and black lentils (urad dal). Known for being soft, fluffy, low-fat, and healthy, these cakes are typically served hot with sambar and chutney for breakfast</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Idli Rice (Parboiled Rice): 2 cups (best for soft texture).</li>
            <li>Urad Dal (Split Skinned Black Gram): 1 cup.</li>
            <li>Fenugreek Seeds (Methi): 1/2 to 1 tsp (crucial for fermentation and aroma).</li>
            <li>Water: For soaking and grinding (use chilled water while grinding to keep the mix cool).</li>
            <li>Salt: To taste (non-iodized sea salt is preferred). </li>
            <li>Cooked Rice: 2 tbsp, blended with the rice.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps for making idlies</h2> 
        <ol>    
            <li> Thoroughly wash the rice and urad dal separately 3-4 times until the water runs clear.<br>
        Soak the rice in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, soak the urad dal along with the fenugreek seeds and, if using, the poha.<br>
        Let them soak for at least 4 to 6 hours. 
            </li>
            <li>Drain the water from the soaked urad dal and grind it in a wet grinder or high-speed blender until it becomes fluffy, light, and smooth. Add ice-cold water in small quantities while grinding to prevent the mixture from heating up, which can make the idlis dense.<br>
                Drain the water from the rice and grind it to a slightly coarse, rava-like texture.<br>
                Combine the ground rice and urad dal batter in a large container.<br>
                Add salt to the mixture. Using clean hands, mix the batter thoroughly for 2-3 minutes. Hand-mixing helps incorporate air and aids in better fermentation. <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the container with a lid (not airtight) and set it in a warm, dark place for 8-12 hours.<br>
                The batter should double in volume and have a slightly sour, fermented smell.<br>

            </li>
            <li> Heat 2 cups of water in an idli steamer or pressure cooker (without the whistle).
                Lightly grease the idli plates with oil.<br>
                Gently stir the fermented batter (do not over-mix, or you will lose the air pockets) and ladle it into the moulds.<br>
                Place the plates in the steamer and steam on medium-high heat for 10-12 minutes.<br>
                Insert a knife or toothpick; if it comes out clean, the idlis are done.<br>
                Let the idlis rest in the pan for 2-3 minutes before removing them. Serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar. <br>
            </li>
