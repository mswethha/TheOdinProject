    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A chappathi is an unleavened, <b><em>whole-wheat flatbread</em></b> that originated in the Indian subcontinent and is now a daily staple across South Asia, East Africa, and the Caribbean. The name comes from the Hindi word chapat, meaning "slap," referencing the traditional method of shaping the dough by slapping it between the palms.
