    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A chappathi is an unleavened, <b><em>whole-wheat flatbread</em></b> that originated in the Indian subcontinent and is now a daily staple across South Asia, East Africa, and the Caribbean. The name comes from the Hindi word chapat, meaning "slap," referencing the traditional method of shaping the dough by slapping it between the palms.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li> Atta: The main ingredient, which gives the chapati its texture and nutritional value.</li>
            <li>Lukewarm water is typically used to help create a soft, pliable dough.</li>
            <li>Oil or Ghee: Used in the dough for softness and applied on top during cooking for flavor and texture.</li>
            <li>Salt: Added to taste, usually a small pinch.</li>
        </ul>
