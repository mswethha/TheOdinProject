    <h2>Steps for making Dosa</h2> 
        <ol>    
            <li>Soak: Wash the rice and urad dal (with methi seeds) separately, then soak them in water for at least 4–6 hours.
            <li>Grind: Drain the water and grind the soaked ingredients separately (or together) into a smooth, thick batter, adding water only as needed.</li>
            <li>Mix & Ferment: Combine the batters in a large bowl, mix well with your hand, cover, and let it ferment in a warm place for 8–12 hours until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Prep: Add salt to the fermented batter and stir it gently to combine.</li>
            <li>Heat: Heat a non-stick or cast-iron tawa (griddle) over medium heat and lightly grease it with oil.</li>
            <li>Spread: Pour a ladleful of batter in the center and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin circle.</li>
            <li>Cook: Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges and cook until the bottom is golden brown and crisp.</li>
            <li>Serve: Lift the crispy dosa from the tawa and serve it hot with chutney and sambar. </li></li>
